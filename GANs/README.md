### 적대적 생성 신경망(GANs)
### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

Generative Adversarial Networks are used to generate images that never existed before. They learn about the world (objects, animals and so forth) and create new versions of those images that never existed.
- 적대적 생성 신경망은 이전에 없었던 이미지를 만들어냅니다. 신경망은 세상에 있는 물체 , 동물 등을 학습하고 새로운 버전으로 이전에 존재하지 않았던 것들을 만들어 줍니다.

They have two components:
- 두개의 요소

- A **Generator** - this creates the images.
  - 생성자 : 이것은 이미지를 만드는 것입니다.

- A **Discriminator** - this assesses the images and tells the generator if they are similar to what it has been trained on. These are based off real world examples.
  - 판별자 : 이것은 이미지를 평가하여 생성자에게 전달합니다. 생성자가 만든것이 그들이 학습한 것과 유사한 것인지를 말해줍니다. 그들이 학습한 예들을 통해서 말이지요.
When training the network, both the generator and discriminator start from scratch and learn together.

### How GANs Work


**G** for **Generative** - this is a model that takes an input as a random noise singal and then outputs an image.

**A** for **Adversarial** - this is the discriminator, the opponent of the generator. This is capable of learning about objects, animals or other features specified. For example: if you supply it with pictures of dogs and non-dogs, it would be able to identify the difference between the two.

Using this example, once the discriminator has been trained, showing the discriminator a picture that isn't a dog it will return a 0. Whereas, if you show it a dog it will return a 1.

**N** for **Network** - meaning the generator and discriminator are both neural networks.


### GANs Process

**Step 1** - we input a random noise signal into the generator. The generator creates some images which is used for training the discriminator. We provide the discriminator with some features/images we want it to learn and the discriminator outputs probabilities. These probabilities can be rather high as the discriminator has only just started being trained. The values are then assessed and identified. The error is calculated and these are backpropagated through the discriminator, where the weights are updated.

Next we train the generator. We take the batch of images that it created and put them through the discriminator again. We do not include the feature images. The generator learns by tricking the discriminator into it outputting false positives.

The discriminator will provide an output of probabilities. The values are then assessed and compared to what they should have been. The error is calculated and backpropagated through the generator and the weights are updated.

**Step 2** - This is the same as step 1 but the generator and discriminator are trained a little more. Through backpropagation the generator understands its mistakes and starts to make them more like the feature.

This is created through a *Deconvolutional Neural Network*.

### Examples

**GANs** can be used for the following:

- Generating Images
- Image Modification
- Super Resolution
- Assisting Artists
- Photo-Realistic Images
- Speech Generation
- Face Ageing
